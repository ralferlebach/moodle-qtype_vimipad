// This question type is an embedding of the ViMi Pad editor. It reuses the

// editor bundle; it does NOT reuse the workspace / operation-log schema — the
// question engine stores the frozen map itself as the attempt response. The
// dependency is therefore declared and pinned to the 0.9.0 API baseline.
